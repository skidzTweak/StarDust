Restrictions have been added to help reduce the chances of fraud.
There are two basic types of restrictions:
1) Restricts how much money can be spent after a purchase for X number of hours.
2) Restricts how much currency can be purchased in X number of days.
* RestrictMoneyHoursAfterPurchase - number of hours money is restricted after purchase
* RestrictMoneyCanSpendAfterPurchase - amount of money they are allowed to spend in restriction
* MaxAmountPurchaseDays - Max Amount purchase pieriod 
* MaxAmountPurchase - Max amount of money they can purcahse

Note: If the amount of money purchased is less than the amount they are allowed to spend after a purchase then only half the currency that was purchased can be spent for X number of hours.
These restrictions will not effect any curreny they already have that is restion free already.
